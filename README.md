# Just a little game of snake

This is a little game of snake written in Python. I wanted to make a small, self-contained program to practice common conventions and scripting across multiple files. This project originated when I was playing around with GTP Engineer, and wanted to test the prompt results and polish up my process for git commits. The original results were very bare-bones and did not function, but gave me an opportunity to improve my review and debug skills, as I was able to treat the original result as if it were code written by a different person. The code has been significantly overhauled and I consider it to be written by myself, not AI-generated code. I got to learn several new Py libraries that interact with graphic elements! Overall, this was an interesting project, taking pre-written code and identifying bugs, cleaning up repetition, reworking logic, etc. 

Also, the game itself is pretty fun.
