# Just a little game of snake

This is a little game of snake written in Python, if that wasn't obvious. I wanted to make a small, self-contained program to practice common conventions and scripting across multiple files. This project originated when I was playing around with GTP Engineer, and wanted to test the prompt results. The code has changed significantly from that point, but it was interesting taking pre-written code and identifying bugs, cleaning up repetition, reworking logic, etc.
